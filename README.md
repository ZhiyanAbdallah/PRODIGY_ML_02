# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to understand their customers' purchasing behaviors and preferences. Without proper segmentation, marketing strategies may be inefficient, leading to missed opportunities. This project applies K-Means clustering to categorize customers based on their annual income and spending behavior.

## Solution
This project implements K-Means clustering to group customers into distinct segments using their annual income and spending score. The insights from clustering help businesses tailor marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and enhance sales performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language
- **Pandas**: Data handling and preprocessing
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: K-Means clustering implementation
- **TensorFlow & Google Colab**: Cloud-based development and data uploading

## Implementation Steps
1. Data Loading:
   - Upload customer data using Google Colab.
   - Read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Feature Selection:
   - Extract relevant features: Annual Income and Spending Score.
3. Data Visualization:
   - Scatter plot of customer data to identify potential clusters visually.
4. Applying K-Means Clustering:
   - Set the number of clusters (k=5).
   - Train the K-Means model on selected features.
   - Assign cluster labels to customers.
5. Cluster Visualization:
   - Use color-coded scatter plots to represent different customer groups.
   - Display cluster centroids to illustrate group centers.

## Business Impact
- Targeted Marketing: Enables businesses to tailor promotions for different customer segments.
- Customer Retention: Identifies high-value customers for loyalty programs.
- Optimized Pricing Strategies: Helps in adjusting prices based on customer spending behavior.
- Better Resource Allocation: Improves decision-making on inventory and advertising spending.

## How to Use
1. Upload the dataset in Google Colab.
2. Run the script to process and visualize the data.
3. Analyze the clusters and their business implications.
4. Use insights to develop customer-specific marketing and sales strategies.

This project provides businesses with a data-driven approach to understanding their customer base, leading to better decision-making and improved profitability.
